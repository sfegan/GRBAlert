# GRBAlert
 
 GCN alert system for VERITAS, from circa 2007, by Stephen Fegan at UCLA.
 
 GCN notices are accepted via a socket link, propagated to the tracking system and also stored in the database.

 I had forgotten how funny the alert sound is (see share/grb.ogg), it really was way over the top in terms of its ridiculousness. I think it must have driven the observers demented.
